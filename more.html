                    <h2>Governance</h2>
                    <p>At the lowest level of governance is Selby Town Council. The town is divided into three electoral
                        wards,
                        north, south and west, each represented by six councillors. These 17 councillors are responsible
                        for
                        burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council
                        are
                        held
                        every four years. The Mayor of Selby is elected annually by the members of the town council.</p>

                    <p>At district level the town is part of the Selby District Council area. The town is represented by
                        seven
                        councillors on the District Council, two each for the west and south wards and three for the
                        north
                        ward. On the North Yorkshire County Council the town is part of the Selby Barlby county division
                        which elects two representatives to the county council. In the United Kingdom Parliament Selby
                        formed part of the Selby constituency until the 2010 general election when it became part of the
                        new
                        seat of Selby and Ainsty. It is represented by Conservative MP, Nigel Adams.</p>

                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Selby lies on the tidal River Ouse in a natural area of Yorkshire known as the Humberhead Levels.
                        The
                        main roads which cross at Selby are the A63 from Leeds to Hull and the A19 from Doncaster to
                        York,
                        though the A19 and A63 no longer meet in Selby itself since the opening of the Selby Bypass in
                        2004.
                        The
                        River Ouse is navigable upstream as far as York so the old toll bridge by which the A63 crossed
                        the
                        river at Selby had to allow for this. For many years the swing bridge in Selby was a notorious
                        local
                        bottleneck but since the opening of the Selby bypass congestion in the town has been relieved.
                    </p>
                    <p>The importance of Selby as a market town has declined in recent decades and its short lived
                        prominence as
                        the centre of the Selby Coalfield has also waned. Selby is close in proximity to both York and
                        Leeds.
                        Its popularity as a tourist destination, due to Selby Abbey, has led to a large amount of
                        development
                        and renovation in the town and surrounding area.</p>
                    <p>The residential areas of Selby have also been subject to expansion and development. A significant
                        development called Staynor Hall continues to be developed on the South East of the town, with
                        other
                        developments in the Holmes Lane area, and around the villages of Brayton, Barlby and Thorpe
                        Willoughby.
                        More have been built at various points along the riverfront, the result of an ongoing project to
                        improve
                        an area that had been largely derelict since the decline of the shipbuilding industry.</p>

                    <h2>Religion</h2>
                    <p>Selby Abbey is one of the largest parish churches in Britain and is larger than several
                        cathedrals.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are various other Christian churches in the town that offer community and differing styles
                        of
                        worship: King's Church, St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Portholme Methodist / URC Church,
                        and St James' Church. Edge Community was founded in 2009 for the Flaxley Road community, and The
                        Salvation Army opened The Church at the Crossroads on the Abbotts Road estate in 2015.</p>
                    <p>Brayton has St Wilfrid's Anglican Church and the Methodist Chapel and All Saints' Church is in
                        Barlby.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Transport</h2>
                    <p>Selby is the transport hub for the local area and has a bus and railway station running services
                        to
                        many
                        places around the area. Train services from Selby railway station run directly to London King's
                        Cross,
                        Leeds, Manchester Piccadilly, York, Hull and other destinations. Arriva Yorkshire have a bus
                        depot
                        in
                        Selby, from where they offer a range of local services, as well as longer services to Goole,
                        Doncaster,
                        Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield and York. Thornes Independent of Hemingbrough also offer a range of
                        services in the area.</p>
                    <p>In July 2001 construction began on the Selby bypass which was authorised for development in 1993.
                        The
                        bypass runs from the A19 at Barlby along the southern perimeter of Selby, joining the A63 at
                        Thorpe
                        Willoughby. The project was delayed due to technical difficulties with the swing bridge over the
                        River
                        Ouse but was eventually completed in July 2004.</p>

                    <h2>Hobson murders</h2>
                    <p>Selby and its surrounding area came to national prominence, once again, through another tragedy
                        on 18
                        July 2004, this time through four exceptionally violent murders carried out by former refuse
                        collector
                        Mark Hobson. Hobson, 34 at the time, killed his girlfriend Claire Sanderson, 27, and her sister
                        Diane at
                        a flat in the nearby village of Camblesforth. He subsequently murdered an elderly couple, James
                        and
                        Joan
                        Britton, at their home in the village of Strensall, near York. Hobson was later sentenced to
                        life
                        imprisonment with the trial judge recommending that he should never be released; the High Court
                        later
                        agreed with this recommendation.</p>

                    <p>The 2001 Great Heck rail crash is also often referred to as the Selby rail crash. It happened a
                        few
                        miles
                        south of Selby, at the village of Great Heck near the M62 motorway, and Selby was the closest

                        town
                        to the accident site. On 28 February 2001, a vehicle crashed off the M62 down an embankment on
                        to a
                        railway track, where it was struck by a passenger train heading to London. The accident was then
                        compounded by a second collision involving an oncoming goods train.</p>

                    <h2>Culture and sport</h2>
                    <p>Selby Town Hall has been running a music venue since 2003, with regular performances of music,
                        dance,
                        drama and comedy and local band nights, with an annual Battle Of The Bands final, which in 2009
                        sold
                        out in 12 hours, seeing local band Leonard's Revenge crowned victors.</p>
                    <p>There have been four cinemas in Selby with the last one closing in the early 1980s. In 2009 a

                        Heritage's At Risk Register, it is anticipated that the development of the Abbot's Staith could

                    <h2>Economy</h2>
                    <p>Much of the historical wealth of the town is based upon its position upon the banks of the tidal
                        River
                        Ouse. In the past, Selby had a large shipbuilding industry and was an important port, due to the
                        Selby
                        Canal which brought trade from Leeds. The Selby Canal links the River Ouse at Selby, to the
                        River
                        Aire
                        at Haddlesey. The replacement Greenpeace craft (1989 – 2011), bearing the name Rainbow Warrior
                        was
                        built in Selby in 1957 as a fishing boat.</p>
                    <p>For a time, Selby was the leading coal mining area in the UK and featured some of the most
                        advanced
                        mining technology in Europe. It was the first new mine in the UK for decades and seen as a
                        rejoinder
                        to
                        widespread concern that the British mining industry was effectively shutting down, particularly
                        following the defeat of the 1984–85 miners' strike.</p>
                    <p>Wistow Colliery, which was part of the Selby Coalfield, holds the UK record for coal mined in one
                        week—200,743 tonnes in 1995. The 110 square miles (280 km2) Selby Complex, employing 3,000
                        miners
                        plus
                        contractors and ancillary staff, closed on Friday 14 May 2004 despite rising demand for coal in
                        the
                        UK.
                        UK Coal, the pit's owner, said closure was due to rising costs caused by deteriorating
                        geological
                        conditions and the falling price of coal. In its final years, the company listed a £30 million
                        loss
                        on
                        the plant.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although much of the infrastructure of the shipbuilding and coal mining industries remain both in
                        and
                        around Selby, both industries have long since been defunct. Present day, the main income for the
                        area is
                        derived from arable farming and as a commuter area for Leeds, Wakefield and York.</p>
                    <p>In recent years, Selby has seen the development of new shopping areas both in the town centre and
                        on
                        the
                        outskirts. The Abbey Walk Shopping Centre was developed on recreational land that runs parallel
                        to
                        the
                        town centre. The expansion not only increased the volume of town centre shops but also provided
                        large
                        scale, convenient parking for the town centre. In more recent years, the Three Lakes Retail Park
                        has
                        opened on the outskirts of town and continues to expand with more developments under
                        construction.
                        Two of the town's supermarkets, Tesco and Morrisons are both looking to expand their stores, the
                        latter
                        meaning the re-siting of the Abbey Primary School.</p>
                    <p>On 14 September 2005, Selby District Council was conditionally granted outline planning
                        permission
                        for a
                        state of the art science facility to be built on the site of Burn Gliding Club but these plans
                        did
                        not
                        come to fruition.</p>

                    <p>Selby's longest established newspaper title is the Selby Times, owned and published by Chronicle
                        Publications along with its sister paper the Goole Times. The company previously owned the Selby
                        Post and purchased the title from Johnston Press when they ceased publication of the paper in
                        August
                        2013. Published weekly, the paper costs 60p. The paper covers the Selby district, including the
                        town
                        centre and villages such as Sherburn-in-Elmet, and as far as Tadcaster.</p>
                    <p>In 2014, despite the shift to online news, The Goole and Selby Times together were only part of
                        three
                        newspapers in the country to actually increase print sales. The Goole Times (incorporating the
                        Selby
                        Times) saw a rise of more than three quarters to 15,045 compared to the same period in 2013.</p>
                    <p>The Goole Times and Selby Times received an unprecedented 1,000 toys for their annual Christmas
                        toy
                        appeal in December 2017.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, The Selby Chronicle was relaunched as an online-only newspaper.</p>
