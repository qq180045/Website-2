                    <h1>Origins (779-1050)</h1>
                    <p>The town's origins date from the establishment of a Viking settlement on the banks of the River
                        Ouse.
                        Archaeological investigations in Selby have revealed extensive remains, including waterlogged
                        deposits
                        in the core of the town dating from the Roman period onwards. It is believed that Selby
                        originated
                        as a
                        settlement called Seletun which was referred to in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of AD 779.</p>

                    <p>The place-name 'Selby' is first attested in a Yorkshire charter c.1030, where it appears as
                        Seleby.
                        It
                        appears as Selbi c.1050. The name is thought to be a Scandinavian form of Seletun, meaning
                        'sallow
                        tree
                        settlement'.</p>

                    <h1>Royalty (1068-1069)</h1>
                    <p>The town of Selby is on the main route north from the Midlands and is the traditional
                        birthplace of King Henry I, fourth son of William the Conqueror, in 1068/69; the connection is
                        supported by William and his wife Matilda's unique joint charter of Selby Abbey, far to the
                        north of
                        their usual circuit of activities, which was founded for Benedict of Auxerre in 1069 and
                        subsequently
                        supported by the de Lacy family. King Henry I is reputed to have been born there in either 1068
                        or
                        1069.
                        A notable feature of the abbey is the 14th-century Washington Window, featuring the heraldic
                        arms of
                        the
                        ancestors of George Washington, the first president of the United States. The design is often
                        cited
                        as
                        an influence for the Stars and Stripes flag.</p>

                    <h1>Abbey (1539-1618)</h1>
                    <p>It is said that the abbey was founded when Benedict saw three swans on a lake in Selby, and he
                        saw it
                        as
                        a sign of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and that is why the official crest of Selby Abbey is
                        three
                        swans. Selby Abbey was closed in 1539 as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry
                        VIII
                        and the majority of the buildings have since been demolished. The central nave of the abbey
                        church
                        survived and in 1618 it became the parish church of Selby.</p>

                    <h1>Civil War (1644)</h1>
                    <p>During the English Civil War, the Royalist garrison of Selby was captured by Parliamentarians in
                        the
                        Battle of Selby on 11 April 1644. There are other historical sites, such as the cholera burial
                        ground on the north side of the abbey, the market cross and the local school, Selby High School.
                        The
                        Market Place has existed since the early 14th century when the market was moved away from the
                        monastery
                        churchyard. The Crescent which curves eastwards from James Street was planned in the early 19th
                        century
                        by a local man, John Audus, after seeing Lansdown Crescent in Bath, Somerset.</p>

                    <h1>shipbuilding (1998-2014)</h1>
                    <p>Selby was also a centre for shipbuilding, with vessels launched into the river. This often
                        required
                        the
                        more unusual technique of launching the vessels side-on into the river due to lack of space for
                        a
                        more
                        conventional stern first or bow first launch. One famous vessel of the Cochrane and Son's
                        shipyard
                        of
                        the town is the preserved trawler Ross Tiger at Grimsby's National Fishing Heritage Centre.
                        Cochrane
                        launched their last vessel into the Ouse in 1998, a historical occasion which people around the
                        area
                        went to see. Once Cochrane had closed, the massive cranes still stood over the skyline of Selby
                        until
                        2001, when seriously strong winds blew them down. Most of the shipyard buildings are still
                        standing
                        (as
                        of February 2014) and the site along with interviews with former employees and archive film was
                        featured
                        in a 2013 video production 'Cochranes of Selby'. The site of the shipyard is currently home to
                        many
                        small businesses who work in the same buildings that were once used to build the Selby ships.
